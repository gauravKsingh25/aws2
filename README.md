# React Todo App

## Overview:

My next project, this is a simple Todo App written in React. The application offers the ability to add tasks, edit them, delete them and list completed tasks. In addition, Todo App allows users to sort tasks by alphabetical order, priority and most recent. The app also allows you to download your task list and import it later, so you don't lose your existing task list. For users' convenience, the site is available in two available themes: light and dark.

I used the following technologies to write the application:
 - React
 - React Hooks
 - SCSS
 - FontAwesome
